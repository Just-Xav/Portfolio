        <h1 class="body-text">Hey there, I'm Xav! I'm 17 years old, and I've been programming for over 5 years now. My journey started with an interest in technology, and it quickly grew into a passion for coding. I’ve worked as a freelance game developer, creating games across different platforms and experimenting with different aspects of development, from gameplay to back-end programming. <br> <br> Although I started with game development, I’ve found that I enjoy building things that solve problems, whether it’s software or something more creative. I still do some game development, however my current priotities rest in software development in order to persue a profession in programmings. I'm currently in my senior year of high school, but I’m already looking ahead to university, where I plan to dive deeper into Computer Science or something else in the IT field. The journey has been exciting so far, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. Whether it’s improving my coding skills, working on new projects, or exploring new areas of tech, I’m excited to see where this path takes me.</h1>
